# OGRE SOLO

Five cards are labelled "Advance Forward"
The Ogre must move straight ahead its maximum move.
The Ogre may only move sideways only to avoid Terrain and the Ogre should avoid terrain consistently.

Choose one of the following rules to keep it consistent:
1. The Ogre always moves right
2. The Ogre always moves left
3. The Ogre always moves the same side as the previous sideways card.
4. The Ogre always moves the opposite side as the previous sideways card.

Two cards labelled "Go Left"
The Ogre must move at least one Hex left.
The Ogre may move more than one Hex left if it will be closer to a “Priority” Target (see below).

Two cards labelled "Go Right"
The Ogre must move at least one Hex right.
The Ogre may move more than one Hex right if it will be closer to a “Priority” Target (see below).

One card labelled "Attack Rear "
The Ogre must remain stationary or if there are targets to the rear, move one Hex backwards.
The Ogre may move more than one Hex backwards if it will be closer to a “Priority” Target (see below).

Shuffle the cards and remove one from the pile, setting it aside without seeing what it says. That way you
don’t know the exact odds of the Ogre moving a particular way.
Now set up the game as you would normally. Put the Command Post and the Ogre on the centre line of
the board.

Now at the start of the Ogre's turn, shuffle the cards and draw one.
Roll a die to determine target priority and roll again to determine weapon Strength. You will try to destroy
targets in order, trying to get weapons in range by adjusting the Ogre’s movement, if possible. Note that
movement can be affected by this roll.

If you do not have the firepower to attain the required weapon strength, use what you can.
The Scenario Objective is always the Primary Target and takes precedent over the target priority for units.
